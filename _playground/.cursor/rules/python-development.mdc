# Python Development - Snake Pit

## High-Level Overview

**All Python development, scripts, and projects MUST go into the `snake-pit` directory.**

```
/home/pi/_playground/snake-pit/
```

This is the **centralized location** for all Python-related work in this workspace.

## Quick Reference

- **Location**: `/home/pi/_playground/snake-pit/`
- **Main Environment**: `.venv/` (shared dependencies)
- **Projects**: `projects/` subdirectory
- **Package Manager**: `uv` (ultra-fast Python package installer)
- **Bootstrap**: `_playground/_scripts/bootstraps/bootstrap-snake-pit.sh`

## Detailed Rules

For comprehensive Python development rules, standards, and best practices, see:

**`/home/pi/_playground/snake-pit/.cursor/rules/`**

This directory contains:
- `python-standards.mdc` - PEP 8, type hints, docstrings
- `project-structure.mdc` - Monorepo layout and organization
- `hardware-raspberry-pi.mdc` - GPIO/I2C/SPI integration patterns

## Key Principles

1. **Centralization**: All Python code lives in `snake-pit/`
2. **Two-tier Environments**: Main `.venv/` for shared deps, project `.venv/` for isolated needs
3. **uv-based**: Use `uv` for ALL package management (standard tool, pip is deprecated)
4. **Tracked**: All Python code is tracked in git (part of `_playground/`)

## Package Management

**`uv` is the standard Python package manager** - All packages MUST be managed with `uv`, not `pip`.

- ✅ **Use `uv pip install`** - Primary tool for all installations
- ✅ **Use `uv venv`** - Create virtual environments
- ✅ **Use `uv run`** - Run commands without activating venv
- ❌ **Avoid `pip` directly** - Only use as fallback if `uv` unavailable

**Why uv?**
- ⚡ 10-100x faster than pip
- 🔒 More reliable dependency resolution
- 📦 Better virtual environment handling
- ✅ Standard across snake-pit and _dev packages

**Migration Status**: All existing pip-installed packages have been migrated to uv. See `_playground/_scripts/migrate-pip-to-uv.sh` for migration script.

## When Working with Python

- ✅ Create new Python scripts/projects in `snake-pit/projects/`
- ✅ Install shared dependencies to main `.venv/`
- ✅ Use project-specific venvs for conflicting dependencies
- ✅ Reference snake-pit rules directory for detailed guidelines
- ❌ Do NOT create Python projects outside `snake-pit/`
- ❌ Do NOT install Python packages globally (use venvs)

## More Information

See `snake-pit/README.md` for setup instructions, project structure, and usage examples.
