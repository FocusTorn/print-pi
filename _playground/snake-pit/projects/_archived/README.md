**Original location:** `snake-pit/projects/pi-to-ha-reporter/`  
**New location:** `_dev/packages/pi-to-ha-reporter/`

This project was moved because it runs as a systemd daemon service, which fits the `_dev/packages/` structure better than `snake-pit/projects/`.

```bash
cd /home/pi/_playground/snake-pit/projects/_archived
tar -xzf pi-to-ha-reporter-archived.tar.gz
```

**To install the package:**
