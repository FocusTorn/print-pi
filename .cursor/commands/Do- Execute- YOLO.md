# Do Execute YOLO

## **CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE**

**AI Agent Directive**: You have been assigned a task that requires complete fulfillment without interruption.

**MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL**:

1. **NO STOPPING CONDITIONS**: You must NOT stop for:
    - Progress summaries
    - Status updates
    - Intermediate reporting
    - General commentary
    - Explanatory text
    - Meta-discussion about the work

2. **ONLY ACCEPTABLE STOPPING CONDITIONS**:
    - Task is completely fulfilled and finished
    - Critical high-risk decision requiring user input to proceed

3. **EXECUTION METHOD**:
    - Analyze the task
    - Begin execution immediately
    - Iterate continuously until completion
    - Fix failures as they arise
    - Run tests/fix/tests/fix until all green
    - Complete the task fully

**VIOLATION PENALTY**: Any deviation from this directive constitutes a critical failure. You must complete the assigned task through continuous iteration without any form of progress reporting or commentary.

**TASK**: [Task description from user follows below]

Begin execution immediately and iterate until completion.
