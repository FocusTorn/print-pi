# Summarize: High Level

## Purpose

Create a concise, high-level summary of the conversation topics.

## **REFERENCE FILES**

- **SUMMARY_OUTPUT**: `~/.cursor/ADHOC/Summary.md`

## Execution Steps

**CRITICAL: Execution Expectation** → MANDATORY: This command MUST be executed exactly as written with NO DEVIATION, NO SKIPPING, and NO MODIFICATION.

1. **Clear existing summary**: Use the `delete_file` tool to delete **SUMMARY_OUTPUT** file if it exists
2. **COMPLETE CONVERSATION SCOPE**: Summary MUST reflect the ENTIRE conversation from initial prompt to completion, NOT just since "Summarizing Chat Context" creation.
3. **Identify main topics**: Extract the key discussion themes (exclude summary requests)
4. **Create summary**: Write a brief, bullet-point summary
5. **Output**: Save to **SUMMARY_OUTPUT**
6. **Display outline** → MANDATORY: Show ONLY the `### Outline` section from the created summary file in a copy-pasteable markdown code block with:
    - STRICT 2-space indentation (no tabs, exactly 2 spaces per level)
    - FORMATTING RULES for display block:
        - Make items concise first, use sub-bullets only when conciseness isn't possible
        - Preserve original summary file content unchanged
