## Oh-My-Zsh Restoration Strategy

### Why OMZ Is Not Fully Tracked

This repo does NOT track the entire Oh-My-Zsh installation (~4MB of framework code, git history, and contributor docs). Instead, we use a **symlink strategy**:

**‚úÖ What IS tracked:**
- `_playground/zsh/custom/` - Your custom plugins, themes, and functions (REAL files)
- `.zshrc` - Your zsh configuration (specifies which plugins/themes to use)
- `_playground/_scripts/bootstraps/bootstrap-omz.sh` - Installation script

**‚ùå What is NOT tracked:**
- `.oh-my-zsh/` - The entire OMZ directory (ignored)
- The OMZ framework itself (can be re-downloaded)
- OMZ `.git` repository (~3.7M of history)
- OMZ `.github/` directory (CI workflows)
- Contributor documentation (CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)

**üîó How Symlinks Work:**
- Real files live in: `_playground/zsh/custom/` (version controlled)
- OMZ uses them via: `.oh-my-zsh/custom` ‚Üí `_playground/zsh/custom/` (symlink)
- This way your configs are tracked, but OMZ framework is not!

### Restoration Process

1. **Clone this repo** to `/home/pi`
2. **Run the bootstrap script:**
   ```bash
   bash _playground/_scripts/bootstraps/bootstrap-omz.sh
   ```
3. **Verify customizations** are loaded in `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/`
4. **Restart your shell** or run `source ~/.zshrc`

### Why This Approach?

- **Smaller repo**: Your restore repo stays lean (only YOUR configs)
- **Always up-to-date**: Re-downloading OMZ gives you the latest stable version
- **Clean separation**: Framework vs. your customizations
- **No git conflicts**: OMZ won't auto-update and mess with your repo
- **Less noise**: No upstream project cruft polluting your commits

### Manual Alternative

If you don't want to use the bootstrap script:

```bash
# Install OMZ manually
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# Clean up cruft (optional)
rm -rf ~/.oh-my-zsh/.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/.github
rm ~/.oh-my-zsh/{CODE_OF_CONDUCT,CONTRIBUTING,SECURITY,README}.md

# Your custom configs should already be in place from the repo
```

## Chamon TUI Restoration Strategy

### What is Chamon?

Chamon is a custom Rust-based TUI (Terminal User Interface) application for system monitoring. It requires compilation from source.

### Restoration Process

**Option 1: Use the install script directly (recommended)**
```bash
cd /home/pi/_playground/_dev/packages/chamon
bash install.sh
```

**Option 2: Use the bootstrap wrapper**
```bash
bash _playground/_scripts/bootstraps/bootstrap-chamon.sh
```

### What the Install Script Does

1. **Checks dependencies**: Verifies Rust/Cargo are installed
2. **Offers bootstrap**: Suggests running bootstrap-rust.sh if deps are missing
3. **Build selection**: Asks if you want dev or prod build
   - **Dev**: Fast compile, includes debug info
   - **Prod**: Slower compile, optimized for performance
4. **Smart wrapper**: Installs to `~/.local/bin/chamon` with intelligent build selection

### How the Wrapper Works

The wrapper script at `~/.local/bin/chamon` is smart:

```bash
# If only one build exists ‚Üí uses it
# If both dev and prod exist ‚Üí uses the newer one automatically!
```

This means you can:
- Rebuild dev for quick iteration: `cd chamon && cargo build`
- Rebuild prod for performance: `cd chamon && cargo build --release`
- The wrapper always uses the most recent build automatically! üöÄ

### Requirements

- **Rust/Cargo**: Required for compilation
  - Install via: `bash _playground/_scripts/bootstraps/bootstrap-rust.sh`
  - Or manually: `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

### PATH Configuration

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
